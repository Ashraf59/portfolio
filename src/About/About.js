        Iâ€™m Md. Ashraf Ali from Chattogram. I completed MBS in Management from National University and MBA in Finance from Premier University. I am very much passionate about programming, hence I was learning coding since 2020 later I took admitted to Programming Hero in 2021 in the 3rd batch, beside the job it was too difficult to continue classes, then I resigned from my 10 years of Accounting job and again took admission in Programming Hero in the 6th Batch.
        <br />
 I successfully completed the main course of 6th Batch web development course. During my learning period, I completed some awesome full-stack projects. Now my ambition is to join as a Web Developer at Home or Abroad.
